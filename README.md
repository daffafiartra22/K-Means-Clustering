# K-Means-Clustering
The dataset used is online retail store data. K-means clustering is applied here to identify the types of customers based on each customer's variables that can be analyzed through the available data. This analysis is expected to provide information about how customer types are divided based on patterns within the data.
In this case i'm using K-Means Clustering method to cluster customer pattern or behaviour on purchasing a product. On my google colab you can see how to handle the missing values as well as creating new fields to make clustering more effective and has much insight to learn .
